## Executive Summary

In today's digital economy, traditional credit assessment models relying solely on financial statements and formal documentation create significant blind spots for lenders. With over **85% of Indian MSMEs operating as sole proprietorships with limited formal financial footprints**, conventional approaches fail to capture the nuanced risk profiles of these businesses.  
This intelligence gap results in suboptimal lending decisions, higher default rates, and missed growth opportunities.

**Privue's alternative data platform** transforms credit risk assessment by integrating non-traditional data signals with conventional financial metrics. By leveraging behavioural indicators, digital footprints, and compliance patterns, financial institutions gain unprecedented visibility into borrower risk profiles—enabling more accurate, inclusive, and profitable credit decisions.

## The Challenge: Beyond Traditional Credit Assessment

### Limitations of Conventional Approaches

- **Incomplete Risk Pictures:** Financial statements alone provide lagging, often manipulated views of borrower health
- **Limited Visibility:** Over 85% of Indian MSMEs operate without audited financials or established credit history
- **Binary Decision Models:** Traditional frameworks create artificial inclusion/exclusion boundaries without risk gradation
- **Operational Inefficiency:** Manual-intensive processes delay decisions and increase underwriting costs
- **Missed Opportunity Cost:** Viable borrowers with limited documentation are systematically excluded from credit markets
