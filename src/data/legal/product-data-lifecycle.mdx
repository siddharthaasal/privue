# Product and Data Lifecycle Policy

**Last updated**: 01 October 2025

At **Privue**, our goal is to maximise value for customers by continually improving our products, datasets, analytics, and the platforms and technologies that support them.  
As we introduce innovations, address evolving market needs, and maintain compatibility with newer technologies, we may upgrade or discontinue certain products, features, datasets, or delivery mechanisms.

We understand that such changes can affect customer workflows, especially where Privue data and services are embedded in business processes.  
This policy explains how Privue manages the lifecycle of products and data so customers can anticipate and plan for change.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to Privue’s commercially available products, data elements, scores and analytics, user interfaces, APIs, reports, and delivery channels provided under an applicable Order, subscription, or agreement.

---

## Guiding Principles

**Continuity of Use Case:**  
Changes will aim to preserve the original business use case and purpose of the Order.

**Transparency:**  
Privue will provide reasonable advance notice of material changes, as set out below.

**Support and Enablement:**  
When changes occur, Privue will provide reasonable documentation, technical support, and, where applicable, training resources to assist customers.

---

## Data Elements

Privue curates and delivers large numbers of data elements from multiple sources. Source availability, regulatory constraints, and market factors may change over time.

**Availability:**  
Privue may add, modify, or retire individual data elements during the term where the original use case and purpose of the Order remains served.

**Format and Layout:**  
Privue may change report formats, configurations, field names, schemas, or layouts, provided there is a functional equivalent and documentation is supplied.

**Legal and Source Constraints:**  
Where a data element becomes unavailable due to legal, regulatory, source, or quality reasons, Privue may remove or replace it without breach, while endeavouring to preserve the intended use case.

---

## Scores and Analytics

Privue routinely validates, monitors, and maintains its scores, indices, and analytics.  
A score or analytic may be discontinued if:

- Validation results indicate under-performance against defined standards
- The development data or methodology is no longer viable
- There are already two or more superseding versions available
- Underlying data is no longer legally available or lacks sufficient statistical or analytical value

**Notice and Alternatives:**

- Privue will provide at least **12 months’ advance notice** of a planned discontinuation, or a shorter period if necessary to address material and imminent regulatory or compliance risks.
- When a score is discontinued, Privue will provide access to a reasonable alternative or successor score where available, along with mapping guidance.
- When new versions are released, Privue will maintain the prior version for a reasonable transition period and provide version notes and migration guidance.

---

## Product Upgrades

Privue may upgrade customers to a next-generation or replacement product with reasonable prior notice, provided that:

- There is no additional charge unless mutually agreed in writing
- Access to the prior version is maintained for a reasonable transition period
- The upgraded product supports the same use case with similar capabilities and functionality
- Privue provides reasonable technical support and training resources
- The original Order terms continue to apply to the upgraded product

Any new features outside the original scope will be handled separately.

---

## Product Sunsets (Discontinuations)

Privue may discontinue or “sunset” a product with **12 months’ advance notice**, or a shorter period if mutually agreed or required to address material and imminent regulatory or compliance risks.

- Contracted fees payable after the effective discontinuation date will be equitably reduced to reflect the value of the Services remaining under the Order.
- Where feasible, Privue will offer a migration path to an alternative product and provide transition guidance.

---

## Notice Mechanics

Notices will be delivered through one or more of:

- In-product notifications
- Email to designated contacts
- Release notes
- Privue’s status or documentation portals

Each notice will include a summary of the change, expected timelines, affected components, and recommended customer actions.

---

## Customer Responsibilities

**Change Management:**  
Review Privue notices and release notes, and plan internal updates to downstream systems, integrations, and processes.

**Technical Readiness:**  
Maintain flexibility in integrations (for example, using field aliases or schema versioning) to accommodate permissible format or element changes.

**Compliance:**  
Ensure your own use of Privue products and data remains compliant with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and internal policies.

---

## Exceptions for Risk, Security, and Compliance

Privue may implement changes with shorter or immediate notice where necessary to address security vulnerabilities, legal or regulatory obligations, data subject rights, or other material risks.  
Privue will communicate the rationale and available options as promptly as practicable.

---

## Documentation and Versioning

Privue will maintain product and API documentation, version histories, and deprecation timelines.  
Customers should consult these materials to plan testing and migration activities.

---

## Fees and Commercial Terms

Unless expressly stated in this policy:

- Upgrades that preserve the existing use case and functionality are provided under the existing Order without additional fees.
- New features, expanded use cases, or additional modules may be subject to separate commercial terms.
- Upon product discontinuation, fees will be adjusted as described in the Product Sunsets section.
