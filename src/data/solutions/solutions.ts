            "Privue is a simple tool that helps you check if a distributor or dealer can pay you. It tells your finance team how much credit to give each distributor. It checks on each distributor every six months. If a distributor starts to struggle, PRIVUE sends an early warning so you can change the credit terms and avoid loss. Privue evaluates each distributor across 300+ data points sourced from public and private repositories. Our credit risk engine integrates these insights with documents provided by the distributor, delivering a comprehensive and accurate assessment of their creditworthiness",
